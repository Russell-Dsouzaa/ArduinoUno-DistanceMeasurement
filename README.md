This project makes use of HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between itself and another object.
The sensor sends out a high frequency sound wave and measures the time it takes for the sound wave to return to the sensor.
This time is then used to calculate the distance between the sensor and the object.<br><br>


Formaula :- Distance = ( speed of sound * time taken ) / 2 <br><br>
